## Sustainable Agile Notwithstanding Enterprise 

- Any organization with more than one product or more than one team has more than one process, you only have the choice of:
  - Accepting that each team will have their own process
  - Ignoring the fact that all but one team is gaming your process to appease you through wasted effort

- The only metrics of value is the team's own confidence in their result and the customer's option of what was delivered so your choces of metric are:
  - ask the teams and the customers for their opinion 
  - create a metric that is easier for the team to falsify than it is to meet

- Any attempt to scale agile is worse than no agile at all, so you can:
  - do agile and let teams decide their process
  - don't do agile and choose another process
  - do something stupid like SAFe that is the worst aspects of both, combined
